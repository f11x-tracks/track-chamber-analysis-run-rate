OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS FOR: Spire/L-M484-TC-4200-10B
================================================================================

🚩 BOTTLENECK: TEL chambers are the primary bottleneck
   └─ Average time: 30.1 minutes vs 0.5 minutes for CHK
   └─ Improvement potential: 98.4% time reduction possible

⚠️  HIGH VARIABILITY CHAMBERS:
   └─ TEL: 20.8% CV (Range: 15.4-37.5 min)
   └─ CHK: 22.9% CV (Range: 0.4-1.5 min)

💡 OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS:
   1. Focus on TEL chamber optimization - highest impact
   2. Investigate process consistency in TEL, CHK chambers
   3. TEL chamber variability (20.8% CV) suggests equipment maintenance needs
   4. Consider load balancing across available chambers
   5. Monitor and address chambers with >20% CV for process consistency
