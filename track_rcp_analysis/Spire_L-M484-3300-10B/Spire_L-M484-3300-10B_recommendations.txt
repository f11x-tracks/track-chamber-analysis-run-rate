OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS FOR: Spire/L-M484-3300-10B
================================================================================

🚩 BOTTLENECK: TEL chambers are the primary bottleneck
   └─ Average time: 16.6 minutes vs 0.5 minutes for CHK
   └─ Improvement potential: 97.3% time reduction possible

⚠️  HIGH VARIABILITY CHAMBERS:
   └─ TEL: 17.6% CV (Range: 10.8-23.0 min)
   └─ CHK: 15.6% CV (Range: 0.4-1.2 min)

💡 OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS:
   1. Focus on TEL chamber optimization - highest impact
   3. TEL chamber variability (17.6% CV) suggests equipment maintenance needs
   4. Consider load balancing across available chambers
   5. Monitor and address chambers with >20% CV for process consistency
