🚩 BOTTLENECK: TEL chambers are the primary bottleneck
   └─ Average time: 23.7 minutes vs 0.5 minutes for CHK
   └─ Improvement potential: 98.1% time reduction possible

⚠️  HIGH VARIABILITY CHAMBERS:
   └─ TEL: 16.1% CV (Range: 14.1-28.6 min)

💡 OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS:
   1. Focus on TEL chamber optimization - highest impact
   3. TEL chamber variability (16.1% CV) suggests equipment maintenance needs
   4. Consider load balancing across available chambers
   5. Monitor and address chambers with >20% CV for process consistency
