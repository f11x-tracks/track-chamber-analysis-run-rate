🚩 BOTTLENECK: TEL chambers are the primary bottleneck
   └─ Average time: 18.8 minutes vs 0.8 minutes for SCP
   └─ Improvement potential: 96.0% time reduction possible

⚠️  HIGH VARIABILITY CHAMBERS:
   └─ TEL: 15.6% CV (Range: 8.9-24.2 min)

💡 OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS:
   1. Focus on TEL chamber optimization - highest impact
   3. TEL chamber variability (15.6% CV) suggests equipment maintenance needs
   4. Consider load balancing across available chambers
   5. Monitor and address chambers with >20% CV for process consistency
