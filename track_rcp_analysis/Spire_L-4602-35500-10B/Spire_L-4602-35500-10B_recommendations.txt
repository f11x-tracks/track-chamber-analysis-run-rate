🚩 BOTTLENECK: TEL chambers are the primary bottleneck
   └─ Average time: 23.0 minutes vs 0.5 minutes for CHK
   └─ Improvement potential: 98.0% time reduction possible

⚠️  HIGH VARIABILITY CHAMBERS:
   └─ TEL: 34.9% CV (Range: 12.2-78.6 min)
   └─ CHK: 17.4% CV (Range: 0.4-1.2 min)

🔧 INDIVIDUAL CHAMBERS NEEDING ATTENTION:
   └─ TEL_ACT12: 23.0 min avg, 34.9% CV

💡 OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS:
   1. Focus on TEL chamber optimization - highest impact
   2. Investigate process consistency in TEL chambers
   3. TEL chamber variability (34.9% CV) suggests equipment maintenance needs
   4. Consider load balancing across available chambers
   5. Monitor and address chambers with >20% CV for process consistency
