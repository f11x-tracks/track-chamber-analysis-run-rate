================================================================================

🚩 BOTTLENECK: TEL chambers are the primary bottleneck
   └─ Average time: 22.1 minutes vs 0.5 minutes for CHK
   └─ Improvement potential: 97.9% time reduction possible

⚠️  HIGH VARIABILITY CHAMBERS:
   └─ CPH: 16.8% CV (Range: 1.6-2.3 min)
   └─ CHK: 23.4% CV (Range: 0.4-1.7 min)

🔧 INDIVIDUAL CHAMBERS NEEDING ATTENTION:
   └─ CHK2: 0.5 min avg, 25.5% CV

💡 OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS:
   1. Focus on TEL chamber optimization - highest impact
   2. Investigate process consistency in CHK chambers
   4. Consider load balancing across available chambers
   5. Monitor and address chambers with >20% CV for process consistency
