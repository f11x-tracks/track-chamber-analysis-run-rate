================================================================================

🚩 BOTTLENECK: TEL chambers are the primary bottleneck
   └─ Average time: 25.8 minutes vs 0.5 minutes for CHK
   └─ Improvement potential: 98.3% time reduction possible

⚠️  HIGH VARIABILITY CHAMBERS:
   └─ TEL: 60.2% CV (Range: 12.2-85.1 min)
   └─ COT: 147.7% CV (Range: 1.9-61.8 min)

🔧 INDIVIDUAL CHAMBERS NEEDING ATTENTION:
   └─ TEL_ACT12: 25.8 min avg, 60.2% CV
   └─ COT141: 2.9 min avg, 222.5% CV

💡 OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS:
   1. Focus on TEL chamber optimization - highest impact
   2. Investigate process consistency in TEL, COT chambers
   3. TEL chamber variability (60.2% CV) suggests equipment maintenance needs
   4. Consider load balancing across available chambers
   5. Monitor and address chambers with >20% CV for process consistency
