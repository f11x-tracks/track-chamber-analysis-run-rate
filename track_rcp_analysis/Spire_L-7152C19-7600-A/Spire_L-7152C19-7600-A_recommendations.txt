OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS FOR: Spire/L-7152C19-7600-A
================================================================================

🚩 BOTTLENECK: TEL chambers are the primary bottleneck
   └─ Average time: 18.2 minutes vs 0.5 minutes for CHK
   └─ Improvement potential: 97.4% time reduction possible

⚠️  HIGH VARIABILITY CHAMBERS:
   └─ TEL: 62.3% CV (Range: 10.8-93.9 min)
   └─ CHK: 31.2% CV (Range: 0.4-2.4 min)

🔧 INDIVIDUAL CHAMBERS NEEDING ATTENTION:
   └─ TEL_ACT12: 18.2 min avg, 62.3% CV
   └─ CHK2: 0.5 min avg, 31.2% CV
   └─ CHK1: 0.5 min avg, 31.2% CV

💡 OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS:
   1. Focus on TEL chamber optimization - highest impact
   2. Investigate process consistency in TEL, CHK chambers
   3. TEL chamber variability (62.3% CV) suggests equipment maintenance needs
   4. Consider load balancing across available chambers
   5. Monitor and address chambers with >20% CV for process consistency
